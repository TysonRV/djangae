# Storage

Djangae provides two storage backends. `djangae.storage.CloudStorage` and `djangae.storage.BlobstoreStorage`.

## Cloud Storage

`djangae.storage.CloudStorage` is a  django storage backend that works with Google Cloud Storage, you can treat it just as
as you would with other storage backends. Google Cloud storage is a general purpose storage backend.

* Cloud storage will use the default bucket name `CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET` unless specified with `BUCKET_KEY` in your settings.py

You can serve files directly from cloudstorage with the key or you can use the included `django.storage.serve_file`
* serve_file will create a proxy in the blobstore which can then be used to serve the file, this may be more useful for access control.

## Blobstore

`djangae.storage.BlobstoreStorage` is a storage backend that uses the blobstore, this may be more suitable for temporary file needs
or file processing and is used as a proxy for serving files from Cloud Storage.
